                    <p>
                        Canada's data infrastructure is inadequate for working with the rapidly growing volume of climate and
                        Earth observation data.  Data Analytics for Canadian Climate Services (DACCS) is a collaboration
                        between the University of Toronto, the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC), the Computer Research
                        Institute of Montr√©al (CRIM), and Ouranos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Data Analytics for Canadian Climate Services (DACCS) project will simplify access to climate
                        and remote sensing data, and will allow scientists and climate researchers to publish their
                        analysis tools alongside the data, thus lowering the barrier to innovation in climate science and
                        opening up new forms of analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning and visualisation tools.

                    <h2>Vision</h2>
                    <p>
                        The aim of the DACCS project is to drastically simplify the time-consuming
                        tasks required to extract relevant climate information from large data sets, allowing researchers to
                        focus on solving scientific problems rather than on data management issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        DACCS is devloping a platform called Marble that will facilitate the conversion of raw climate data
                        from satellite observations and simulation models into relevant, credible and actionable information products.
                        The Marble Platform is comprised of reusable modular components that will provide services to a broad scientific
                        community through a unified user interface for: dataset search and discovery; user data management; data analytics;
                        visualisation; workflow management; publishing; and application deployment. As part of a larger Federated Cloud
                        Infrastructure, through Marble, scientists can access data from different sources and process them using
                        existing algorithms developed by the academic, government and private sectors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Marble Platform will foster the creation of a new generation of advanced data
                        analytics tools, in order to better understand the relationships between remote sensing data,
                        climate model projections, and climate change impact studies.
